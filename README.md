# Hiii & Welcome
## Kultur Notiert is my capstone project for neuefische Web Development Bootcamp
In this app, you can have a list with all those books you never manage to read and all those films your best friend has told you to watch 1000 times.
You will end up with your personal culture watchlist (e.g. books, movies, exhibitions, festivals).
Once read or watched or visited, you can store these cultural experiences in your personal collection.
Feel free to leave a rating or notes.
Maybe connect with your friends to see what's on their cultural agenda? Let's see if I'll make it till there ;-)

Just started, all work in progress as you can see.
