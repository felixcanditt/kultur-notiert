# Hiii & Welcome

## Kultur Notiert is my capstone project for neuefische Web Development Bootcamp

In this app, you can create a list with all those books you never manage to read and all those films your best friend has told you to watch 1000 times.

You will end up with your personal culture watchlist (books, movies, series, music, performing arts, exhibitions, festivals).

Once read or watched or visited, you can store these cultural experiences in your personal collection. Feel free to add a rating or notes.

Enjoy <3

## How to install and run this app

After cloning this repository, simply run `npm install` in the main directory â€“ this will also install all dependencies of `client`.

Then start the app by entering `npm run client`.
